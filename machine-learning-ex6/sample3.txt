Hello CHKN Army!

And welcome to anyone who is new this week! Your numbers are growing, we can barely keep up with you crazy creators. 
Let's see what the Dev Team is up to.
We are putting the last bits of polish on the game to gear up for Early Access. Kevin has been working on refining some of the structure animations, as well as working on a new creature; a DRAGON!

John is working on the whistle, a tool that you can craft and use to control and call your creatures. Roman had a strange encounter with a neighbor while building his structure. Read more about it on our Steam Page!

So what's new in the community?
A LOT.

We found some great fan art this week!

Have a great weekend everyone!
